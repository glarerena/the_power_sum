I used the Hackers Realm Youtube Walkthrough video for this challenge.

The Power Sum Function counts how many ways we can express a number as the sum of unique numbers raised to the power.

It takes X & N as parameters.

The helper function takes total, power, and num_present as parameters.
Total = how much of X
Power = is it squared or cubed
num_present = the current number we are using 

If total becomes zero it means its working. 
If it goes below zero we have went to far.

The function calls itself to explore different outcomes.
